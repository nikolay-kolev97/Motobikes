            <h1>Types of motorbike</h1>
            
            <h3>Do you know the difference between a chopper and a cruiser? <br>
               And what exactly is a naked bike?</h3>
            
            <p>There are loads of motorbike categories and its important to know what sort of bike you’re buying. Here’s a rundown on the different motorcycle types, what they are designed for and how they are commonly used.</p>
         
        </div>
          <div id="section2" class="container-fluid bg-warning" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Scooters and mopeds</h1>
  
            <p> Mopeds are small-engine bikes (max 50cc) that have a top
                    speed of around 28mph. As mopeds have such low power, moped insurance cover tends
                    to be much cheaper. Scooters have larger engines than mopeds, normally 125cc-150cc,
                     and have a step-through frame. The smaller engine will tend to reduce their running 
                     costs and makes them much more affordable than bigger bikes.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="section3" class="container-fluid bg-secondary" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Sports bikes</h1>

            <p>At the other end of the spectrum, sports bikes are built for power and speed. 
              They have fast and powerful engines, sharp styling and handling, and aerodynamic fairings.
                Dominated by Japanese giants Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha, other makes include
                 Ducati (Italy) and Triumph (good old Blighty). As sports bikes are built for speed and
                  have blistering acceleration, novice riders should think carefully before opting for one
                   of these as their first ride.</p>
          
            </div>
          <div id="section4" class="container-fluid bg-danger" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Naked bikes</h1>

            <p>In a nutshell, these are un-faired sports bikes. The term "Naked" refers to road bikes without
               a fairing to obscure the engine and frame, and normally no screen at all over the handlebars.
                However, not all bikes without fairings are naked bikes. Exceptions include custom bikes, 
                off-roaders and adventure sport bikes.</p>
          
            </div>
          <div id="section5" class="container-fluid bg-info" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Cruisers</h1>

           <p>For all you wannabe Easy Riders, cruisers are most easily described by one evocative and
              legendary brand, Harley Davidson. Typically, cruisers have low seats, long wheel bases,
              of chrome and, most importantly, a laid-back attitude. Harleys aren’t the only name in town 
              though, with a range of Japanese bikes able to provide that custom look for a lot less cash
               but also less heritage. Other cruiser makers include Italian firm Moto Guzzi and BMW.
            Some cruisers, such as the massive Kawasaki VN2000, have larger engines than some mid-size 
            cars and are definitely not recommended for bikers who’ve just removed their stabilisers.</p>
          
        </div>
          <div id="section6" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Adventure/Adventure sport</h1>

            <p>Adventure bikes are designed to be a jack of all trades, suited to commuting, touring, 
              and some sporty riding. They tend to be endurance machines with larger luggage compartments
               and petrol tanks for long distance trekking. They will also often have the capability to do
                a bit of off-road. But be warned, taking a larger, heavier bike off-road can be a challenge 
                to even the most experienced rider, especially if you drop it. A tall profile and upright
                 riding position mean you’ll get good visibility over the car in front, and you’ll also be
                  easier to see for other road users. King of this class is arguably the BMW R1250GS, while
                   Suzuki’s V-Strom 1000 (pictured above) is one of the more affordable big adventure bikes.</p>
         
            </div>
          <div id="section7" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Touring motorcycles</h1>
           
            <p>If you’re looking to ride coast to coast across the US or take a European tour, then a tourer
               is the bike for you. Designed for long distances, these are big, comfortable, mile-munching
                monsters.These bikes are built for on-road comfort for both rider and pillion, with 
                continent-cruising ability. Many tourers have large windscreens, generous luggage capacity, 
                plush seats, driver/passenger intercom and heated handlebar grips, along with a dashboard
                 full of tech.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="section8" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Dirt bikes, Enduro bikes and Motocross bikes</h1>
          
            <p>All these are variations of bikes that are primarily or solely used for off-roading.
               There are hundreds of styles and variations of off-road bikes, from enduro bikes that 
               are used for long distance off-roading, through to trials bikes, that are so lightweight 
               they don’t even have a seat.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="section9" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Monkey bikes and Groms</h1>
           
            <p>Honda released their first monkey bike in the 60s. Originally with a 50cc engine, 
              the Monkey was a compact or minibike and its name came from the way it makes the riders
               knees and elbows stick out. Modern monkey bikes tend to be 125cc and while other
                manufacturers have their own versions, it’s the Honda Monkey that is still the king 
                of this category.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="section10" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Quad bikes</h1>

            <p>Usually used off-road or in competitions, quad bikes are a unique breed.
                Whether it’s used for agriculture, modified for your own purpose or for sports and leisure,
                 a quad bike can be covered under quad bike insurance.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="section11" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Trikes</h1>
        
            <p>A trike is a larger motorbike that runs on three wheels instead of two.
                Many trikes are built with components found in cars, and cars on three wheels also use parts
                 found in motorcycles, so it can become confusing when it comes to insuring your trike.</p>

          </div>
          <div id="section12" class="container-fluid" style="padding-top:70px;padding-bottom:70px">
            <h1>Which motorbike category should I buy?</h1>

            <p>Whatever type of motorbike you ride, you need to make sure it fits your lifestyle.
                That Ducati Streetfighter might look the business with an engine sound like a pride of 
                roaring lions, but 28kg of downforce at 168mph doesn’t do you much good when you’re stuck
                 in the traffic of a daily commute. Buy a bike that suits your needs, is the right power
                  and size, and not so heavy that you can barely lift it.</p>
